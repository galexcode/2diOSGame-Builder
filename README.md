Discription:
This is a game developed by using cocos2d, one of the most widely used open source SDK for 2d mobile game development. This game is optimized on both 3.5inch and 4inch devices.  The main idea of this game comes from the classic, TETRIS, but enhanced with more features, for instance, there is ice brick, as long as there is one contained in a row, the row cannot be removed even the whole row is filled, in order to remove the row, the player needs to make a sequence of continuous rows with height of at least 4 or simply use the fire widget. Couple of more features and also widgets are added. Besides that, I provide players with two game modes, classic and survival. In survival mode, several shapes can drop down at the same time, and the player can only control the one at the bottom; on the other hand, only one shape can drop from the top, give the player more time to "breathe".
